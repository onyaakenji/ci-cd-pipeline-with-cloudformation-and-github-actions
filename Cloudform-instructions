Technologies. The company has a requirement to automate the deployment of a static website
using AWS CloudFormation, Amazon S3 bucket, and GitHub Actions pipeline. The website
consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

Actions pipeline that automatically deploys the website whenever changes are made to the
codebase.

	execution?
